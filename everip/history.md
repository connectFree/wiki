# Why Now? Why was EVER/IP not developed sooner?

## The reason is hard rooted in the economics of scale.


## In the 1980s when the Internet was first developed, computers were of limited computational resource. Therefore, it was decided that in order to effectively route millions of packets per second, trade-offs had to be made and the Internet became a system of pre calculated routes that had to be saved in very fast, very expensive memory.


## This lack of computational power forced the implementation of the current Internet to become memory-bound and thus its core infrastructure requires tremendous dedication, resource and electricity. The complexity in managing this core infrastructure has become a major industry, keeping the cost of communication relatively high and core growth relatively low.


## Fast-forward three decades, EVER/IP is the first kind of routing software that does not require memory expensive routing tables, but instead uses the CPU to calculate forwarding direction based entirely on local information.


## Being entirely local information driven, there is no need for expensive Internet service providers (ISPs), thus reducing the cost of communication for people and things alike.


## Thanks in part to the iPhone(r)(1) and other smartphones of its generation, the computing power that we have in our pocket is incredible. EVER/IP aims to unleash this power, bringing-down the cost of communications worldwide and beyond.


## Companies like Microsoft helped take us from yesterday's mainframe into the Personal Computer era with "micro-software." We aim to take humanity from today's mainframe (cloud) into the Personal Communications era with Micro Internet eXchanges (MIXes).
