# What makes EVER/IP a unique solution?

- You own your own IP Address forever. No monthly costs.
- Your IP Address is authenticated, so that no one can become you.
- All communications are encrypted, which is very important for banking and infrastructure.
- Works with existing network technologies (WiFi, Ethernet, Fibre, etc.) so that there is no cost to rebuild networks
- Existing applications just work: EVER/IP reports itself to the Operating System as a VPN.
- No need for network administrators: network configuration is instant and autonomous.

## While there are other dynamic routing solutions and VPNs that interface with the IPv6 address space, EVER/IP is the only IPv6 solution that can calculate forwarding direction based entirely on local information. Other open-source projects such as CJDNS, SAFE Network and IPFS use forms of memory-backed routing tables or route labels to facilitate connectivity.

## In contrast, EVER/IP makes routing decisions by calculating differences between connected coordinates in a larger network graph. EVER/IP's low memory footprint gives it the edge in any embedded project or application.
