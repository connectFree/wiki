# About Ever/IP

## Ever/IP is a new way to think about building the Internet by redefining who owns the Internet. When the Internet was first developed in the 1980s, the Internet has lacked a truly distributed means of deciding who owns each IP address on the Internet.

## Even today, the Internet relies on an archaic system of bureaucratic organizations known as the "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority", or IANA, which has costly operations throughout the world. With Ever/IP, IP addresses are backed by public/private cryptographic key pairs and thus IP addresses may become established as property.
